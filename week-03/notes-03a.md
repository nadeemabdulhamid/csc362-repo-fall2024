### General Understanding
1. **What is the purpose of the `LogIterator` class, and how does it interact with the `LogMgr` class?**

2. **Why is it useful to read the log records in reverse order in the `LogIterator` class?**

3. **How does the `LogMgr` ensure log records are written and read efficiently?**

### Exploring Specific Methods
4. **How does the `hasNext()` method in `LogIterator` determine if there are more log records to read?**

5. **What is the purpose of the `moveToBlock()` method in `LogIterator`, and why is it necessary to load the block before reading records?**

6. **In `LogMgr`, how does the `append()` method manage the boundary and ensure there is enough space for new log records?**

### Design and Functionality
7. **Why are the log records written from right to left in the buffer in the `append()` method? How does this affect reading the records?**

8. **Why is it important to flush the buffer in `LogMgr`, and when is this done?**

9. **What is the purpose of `flush(int lsn)` in `LogMgr`, and how does it relate to data consistency?**

### Implementation Details
~~10. **What is the role of `BlockId` and `FileMgr` in both classes, and how do they contribute to the logging mechanism?**~~

10. **Provide explanatory comments for the private fields in both classes.**

11. **How does `LogIterator` use the `Page` class, and what is the significance of storing the log records in a byte array?**

12. **In `LogMgr`, why does the `appendNewBlock()` method create a new block, and what happens to the old block?**
